# PC Build for Gaming in 2025

After four years, I have finally built a new PC.

| Component     | Name                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Motherboard   | MSI MPG X670E CARBON WIFI                                    |
| CPU           | AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D                                          |
| CPU Cooler    | ARCTIC Liquid Freezer III 360                                |
| Graphics Card | Colorful iGame RTX 4080 SUPER Advanced OC 16GB               |
| RAM           | Predator Hera DDR5 6400 32GB * 2                             |
| Hard Drives   | Samsung 990 PRO 2TB / Samsung 980 PRO 1TB / WD Black SN750 1TB |
| PSU           | Super Flower Leadex VII XG 1300W                             |
| Case          | Fractal Design North XL (Chalk White, TG Clear)              |
| Rear fan      | Thermalright TL-B14B EXTREM (Black)                          |

I'm keeping my old graphics card and SSDs until I can afford the RTX 5090, which is now sky-high in price. 🙂

## Why?

I have been playing World of Warcraft again for several months now, and my previous build's CPU (AMD Ryzen 7 5800X) is obivously the bottleneck. An X3D CPU will perform better in MMORPGs, even at 4K resolution (NB: I play all games in 4K, regardless of framerate).

And since I am a pro-4K guy, I would like to get the latest RTX 5090 so that I can have a better experience.

## Consideration

### Motherboard

I bought a brand-new X670E motherboard for this build because I'm not interested in the latest chips (X870, X870E & B850) featuring USB4, which sacrifices some original PCIe lanes. Besides, I don't need >= 5GbE LAN as my home network currently runs at 1GbE and isn't slated for a major upgrade until 2027.

Cost-effectiveness matters here, since a motherboard rarely offers significant performance gains.

MSI MPG X670E CARBON WIFI is a motherboard which has 4 M.2 slots and I love the extensibility of it.

### PSU

I did tons of research before making my decision, and to be honest, the Leadex VII XG 1300w was not my first pick. I initially bought [FSP's Hydro PTM PRO 1350W](https://www.fsplifestyle.com/en/product/HydroPTMPRO1350W_12V2X6.html) which had a problem that I just couldn't stand. You can check out the video in the next section for more details.

### Use Cases

It's mainly a gaming PC, so FPS matters here. I might use it for some development work but I prefer using my MacBook Pro (M1 Pro) over this, if possible.

## Tuning

### CPU

Just enable the PBO settings. Bang!

### RAM

There are lots of posts and screenshots of settings to guide you how to tweak your RAM. Overclocking 32GB x2 is a bit more physically challenging than 16GB x2, so make sure to double-check whether the post you're viewing fits your case. If you decide to buy the same RAM as I did, the screenshot above might provide some helpful clues.

#### Why 6200 with CL28?

- You won't see much performance gain by opting for a higher frequency (e.g., 8400) RAM
  - The X670E chip might not even work with DDR5 8000+ RAM either, according to [the compatibility list](https://www.predatorstorage.com/u_file/fileUpload/2024-12/16/Memory%20Module%20Platform%20Compatibility%20List.pdf) on Predator's website.
- Lower latency will definitely benefit MMORPG performance.

## Known Issues

### AIO Cooler

- All the fans suddenly stop spinning, which caused CPU overheat and shutdown. It just happened once, though.

### PSU

- The Hydro PTM Pro 1350W, for which I have already requested a refund, produces a horrible "tada-tada" sound when the CPU and GPU are under moderate load:
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9B8Pv2efoug?si=CkDImFgoIAlhaGbi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  
  Before requesting a refund, I contacted their technical support and they told me that this is normal - it's the sound produced when the PC reaches the critical point between low and medium load.

  At first, I thought this was an acceptable answer since it's completely reproducible by controlling the maximum FPS in the game settings. However, I think this will become extremely annoying if I have to configure every game's settings.

  Before asking for a refund, I requested an exchange but the issue remained exactly the same. Personally, I consider this an unacceptable flaw, and I'm not sure if it's an only isolated case.

### Misc.

- There is some buzzing noise that I can't yet confirm the source right now when the PC is not under load or even hibernate. It could last for several seconds and is quite annoying since I expect my work environment to be as quiet as possible when the PC is idle (i.e., when I'm not playing games).
  - I suspect it's coming from the PSU, but it seems that every PSU I've bought has the same issue, which is quite confusing.
- The GPU might have some [coil whine](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=coil+whine) when it's under load, but that's acceptable to me since I'll likely be gaming with the speakers on.
